Image Processing Waste Sorting
# Project Overview
This project utilizes image processing and machine learning to automatically classify and sort waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the system enhances waste management efficiency and promotes environmental sustainability.
 # Features
-Image Acquisition: Captures images of waste items using a camera.
-Preprocessing: Applies filters and transformations for better classification.
-Feature Extraction: Identifies key characteristics of waste materials.
-Classification Model: Uses machine learning to determine if waste is biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
-Sorting Mechanism: Provides signals to actuators for automated waste segregation.

# Technologies Used
-Programming Language: Python
-Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
-Hardware (Optional): Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Camera Module, Servo Motors
